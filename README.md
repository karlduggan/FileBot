# ScreenShot_CleanUp
ScreenShot  File Bot

While inspecting websites for defects, I suppport my findings by taking screenshots. 
After working through the entire website I might end up with 30+ screenshots which will have littered my dekstop.
I deciding to create a program that would run in teh background while I inspects websites. Whilst it is running it will create a 
folder on the desktop and move the screenshots to the folder while also renaming the files chronologically so that they can be easily found after operation
